# Project Shinobiri
##### Shinobiri is a tool for discreet commerce..
Capstone project for the TTS 2016 part-time bootcamp.   
The idea was to create a "craigslist" clone where the users sell     
goods and control their transactions online.

##### The name:
"Shinobi-iri", the art of stealth refers to the abilities of ninjas to remain unseen and undetected.
